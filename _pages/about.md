Hi! I'm Namit, a graduate researcher at the University of Maryland specializing in survey methodology and data science. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between traditional survey research and cutting-edge AI technologies.

Currently, I'm working as a Research Assistant at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, where I'm conducting geospatial epidemiological research on COVID-19 patterns across U.S. census tracts. My work involves developing stratified analytical frameworks for large-scale data with complex missing patterns.

## My Research Journey

My research agenda focuses on developing trustworthy data integration frameworks that combine survey methodology principles with generative AI, deep learning architectures, and privacy-preserving computational methods. I believe that by fusing these approaches, we can advance automated data collection, quality assurance, and responsible measurement at scale.

I've published research in peer-reviewed venues (Springer) and presented at the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) conference on transformer-based sentiment analysis methodologies.

## Education

I'm currently pursuing my **Master of Science in Survey & Data Science** (Data Science track) at the University of Maryland's Joint Program in Survey Methodology (JPSM), where I've been recognized with a Dean's Fellowship and maintain a 3.79/4.00 GPA. Before this, I completed my **Bachelor of Engineering in Civil Engineering** with a Minor in Data Science from BITS Pilani.

## Professional Experience

### Current Roles
- **Research Assistant** at University of Michigan Institute for Social Research
- **Teaching & Graduate Assistant** at UMD Joint Program in Survey Methodology

### Previous Experience
- **Machine Learning Engineer** at Legistify - Developed IP infringement detection systems processing 2.4M images
- **Advanced Application Engineering Analyst** at Accenture - Conducted penetration testing and threat intelligence analysis

## Research Interests

I'm particularly interested in:
- Survey methodology and causal inference
- Transformer-based NLP and sentiment analysis
- Geospatial epidemiology and statistical modeling
- Privacy-preserving AI and data integration
- Machine learning for social sciences

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss research collaborations or just chat about data science and survey methodology!
