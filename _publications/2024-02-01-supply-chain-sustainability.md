## Overview

This research investigates the critical intersection of Industry 4.0 technologies and sustainable supply chain management in the automotive sector, particularly relevant during disruption periods like the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Research Methodology

### Survey Design & Data Collection
- Designed and executed a **qualitative survey study** with **200+ automotive supply chain experts** across India
- Employed **fuzzy-set Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP)** to rank **5 Industry 4.0 technologies** and **6 green supply chain practices**
- Achieved **consistency ratios below 0.10 threshold**, validating expert judgment reliability across all matrices

### Analytical Framework
- Developed a hierarchical **Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM)** framework integrating **MICMAC analysis**
- Mapped causal relationships between digital technologies (IoT, Big Data Analytics, Cloud Computing) and sustainable practices
- Identified government regulation and top management commitment as key drivers with **highest driving power (score of 9 out of 9)**

## Key Findings

1. **Technology Ranking**: IoT, Big Data Analytics, and Cloud Computing emerged as critical linkage factors with **driving power 7, dependence power 7**

2. **Sustainable Practices**: Established quantitative linkage between Industry 4.0 adoption and green supply chain performance through **three-level hierarchical structure**

3. **Driver Analysis**: Government regulations and top management commitment identified as fundamental drivers enabling effective supplier-customer collaboration and circular economy practices

## Impact & Implications

This research provides actionable insights for:
- **Industry practitioners** seeking to integrate digital technologies with sustainability goals
- **Policymakers** developing regulations for sustainable supply chain practices
- **Researchers** investigating the intersection of Industry 4.0 and environmental sustainability
