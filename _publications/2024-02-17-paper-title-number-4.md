This research examines how Industry 4.0 technologies enable sustainable supply chain practices during disruptions. I designed and executed a qualitative survey study with 200+ automotive supply chain experts across India, employing fuzzy-set Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to rank 5 Industry 4.0 technologies and 6 green supply chain practices.

## Key Findings

We developed a hierarchical Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) framework integrating MICMAC analysis to map causal relationships between digital technologies (IoT, Big Data Analytics, Cloud Computing) and sustainable practices. The research identified:

- Government regulation and top management commitment as key drivers with highest driving power (score of 9 out of 9)
- IoT, Big Data Analytics, and cloud computing function as critical linkage factors (driving power 7, dependence power 7)
- Consistency ratios below 0.10 threshold, validating expert judgment reliability

This work establishes a quantitative linkage between Industry 4.0 adoption and green supply chain performance, demonstrating how these technologies enable effective supplier-customer collaboration and circular economy practices.
