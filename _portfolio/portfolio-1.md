I developed a sophisticated cross-classified multilevel model analyzing 7,023 player-season observations from 2,159 elite European football players. This research quantifies factors driving the €38 billion European football transfer market.

## Project Highlights

### Statistical Modeling
- Engineered cubic polynomial time-series model capturing non-linear market dynamics
- Achieved 78% player-level variance explanation
- Identified squad status (playing time) driving 42% market valuation premium

### Market Insights
Successfully isolated COVID-19's structural impact on the market through 2020-centered temporal analysis. Quantified systematic valuation disparities:
- 65% discount for goalkeepers
- 34% discount for East Asian players  
- 21% premium for Latin American talent
- 17% discount for domestic citizens

### Technical Skills
- **R Programming**: lme4 package for multilevel modeling
- **Statistical Analysis**: Complex variance component analysis
- **Data Visualization**: ggplot2 for market trend visualization

This project provides data-driven insights for €8.7bn post-pandemic market optimization.
